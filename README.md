***
Update 21/1/2016: 

* changed handling of user's guess to take advantage of angular two-way data binding

***
Wishlist:

* have a way to choose difficulty that would select for shorter words or more common words
* display of word's dictionary definition either to help with unscramble or for post-unscramble edification
* improved accessibility, beyond use of semantic elements
* additional styling (transitions etc)
